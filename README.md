This project aims to enhance Kickstarter's revenue by leveraging its data to identify high-potential early-stage companies for investment. Using the Kickstarter dataset, we developed machine learning models to predict which companies on the platform are likely to experience significant growth in the near future. This approach offers a new revenue stream for Kickstarter by enabling strategic investments based on data-driven insights.
